			<p id="desc">Jackals are anything but picky when it comes to eating, but their habits are definitely gross. These scavengers will scarf decomposing or diseased flesh, even if it's been rotting for days. When lions and tigers are done with their kills, jackals will gladly move in for the sloppy seconds.</p>
